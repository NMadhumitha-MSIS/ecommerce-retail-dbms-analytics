# E-Commerce Retail Platform — Database Management & Analytics

## Overview
This project implements a database-driven e-commerce retail system focused on transactional reliability, data integrity, and business analytics. It combines relational database design, stored procedures, triggers, encryption, and visualization to support real-world retail operations.

## Project Scope

- Customer and order management
- Inventory and supplier tracking
- Secure payment handling
- Employee and store management
- Business intelligence and KPI reporting

## Database Design
- Designed a normalized relational schema using ER modeling
